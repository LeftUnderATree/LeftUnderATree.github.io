This is our main character — the diver

/Img/2.gif

/Img/3.gif

Since he is underwater, he naturally glides through the water column

/Img/4.gif

During his descent, he encounters underwater currents that change his direction of movement

/Img/5.gif

If he wants, the diver can resist the current, but his speed will be extremely low

/Img/6.gif

If he swims with the current, his speed increases significantly

The main antagonist in the game is seaweed, which damages and pushes the player

/Img/8.gif

When the diver reaches the end of the map, the level transitions and his health is fully restored and saved

The game currently features three levels: “Green Bottom,” “Underwater Laboratory,” and “Cosmic Depth.”
