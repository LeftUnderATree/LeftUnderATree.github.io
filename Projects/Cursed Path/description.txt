Cursed Path
---
Cursed Path is a PS1-style survival horror vertical slice. The game features five unique enemy archetypes, a two-phase boss fight, and audio-driven navigation where players must rely on sound cues to survive. A minimalist, contextual HUD reinforces immersion â€” only appearing when relevant. Built in Unity, the project demonstrates AI design, atmosphere, and retro visual style.
