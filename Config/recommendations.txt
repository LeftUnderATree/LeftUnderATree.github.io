Niko quickly became a core creative force in our team. His conceptual thinking, speed, and attention to spatial detail allowed us to pitch and win several high-profile exhibition projects. Beyond his visuals, what makes Niko stand out is his calm, precise communication and ability to align with any team around a shared vision.

Working with Niko was an absolute pleasure. He handled several key short film sequences from modeling to final render with complete autonomy. His sense of timing, form, and atmosphere made the visuals come alive. He understands storytelling through 3D on a deep level — something that’s hard to find.

Niko brought a rare combination of technical mastery and design sensitivity to our project. His ability to turn rough ideas into polished, production-ready 3D models was a game-changer for our pipeline. He works fast, communicates clearly, and is incredibly dependable. I’d trust him on any high-stakes project again without hesitation.

Niko was one of our most impactful lecturers. His workshops were always full, and his teaching style was approachable yet demanding in the best way. Students often cited him as a turning point in their understanding of 3D. He not only teaches software, he teaches thinking visually — and that’s rare.
