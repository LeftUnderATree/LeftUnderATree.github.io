With a strong multidisciplinary background in CG, I specialize in crafting immersive visual experiences across multiple creative domains. From directing music videos and short films to designing album covers, 3D environments, and interactive spaces, my work seamlessly blends artistic vision with technical precision.

I have a passion for building compelling digital worlds—whether it’s through game development (visual novels, platformers, shooters, and exploratory experiences) or architectural and product visualization. Every project I take on is driven by a commitment to aesthetic excellence and storytelling, ensuring that each piece resonates with its audience on a deeper level.
